a)
Q1: plot for N=100:    1/1
Q2: plot for N=1000:   1/1

b)
Q3: create 1000 random variables based on distribution:    1/1
Q4: compute the standardized sum for N=1,10,100:      1/1
Q5: plot the cdf of standardized mean for N=1,10,100:      1/1

c)
Q6: Plt observations:         0.5/1 (we were expecting an interpretation of the relationship between the gaussian distribution and the CDF) 

Total:                        5.5/6
